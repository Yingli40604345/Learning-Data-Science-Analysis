# Web-Scraping

•	Created and applied a web crawler to Century 21 webpages. Acquired the content on the pages using the Requests Library and parsed out the files formatted in HTML using the BeautifulSoup Library.  

•	Inspected and iterated the elements from the webpages sourcecode, identified the rules and grabbed targeted data based on different tags.  

•	Handled exceptions and cleaned the data. Stored the output into a CSV file.
